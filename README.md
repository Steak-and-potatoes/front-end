C- Css, brainstorming ideas and teamwork/cooperation, open to constructive critisism.
B- Linux commands.
J- Css and React Wizard.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

At the start of class we want to all touch base and see what work has been done on the previous day and as well see what tasks would be best for each person to tackle next.

## Conflict

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

We plan on being upfront and clearly explaining where we are at to our teamates. Speak out or dilemmas at our daily meetups at the start of class.

Refer to previous prompt. "Everyone has a right to understand all of the code."

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Refer to first prompt. With patients and kindness.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

If someone is slacking off more than everyone else gets to learn more by doing their code for them!

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

All of it!

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Create an organization with all of us!

- Git flow:

Each of us will have our own branch to work on and then once we push it up we will have multiple eyes on the merge before it reaches main.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow?

For a layer of security, we will have someone who didn't write the code double check. A minimum of 2 people will review.
